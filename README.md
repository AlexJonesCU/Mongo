# Mongo

I created a python file to use faker to generate random student data into a txt file <CreateStudents.py>

Then imported the file into the Student database in MongoDB Compass Application with the Add Data button and imported the Students.txt file I created.

Then I connected to the Student Database through pycharm and followed the steps we did in class. 

This pycharm file utilizes the .find() function which is similar to a SELECT and then the print(s) syntax, which is similar to how you would use a WHERE statement.

I also experimented the .sort() function, which orders the entries in in a column in ascending or descending order.
